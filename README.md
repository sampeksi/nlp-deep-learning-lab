# NLP Deep Learning Lab

This repository contains weekly assignments and exercises for an NLP (Natural Language Processing) deep learning course, covering various fundamental and advanced topics in natural language processing using deep learning techniques.

## Weekly Assignments

### Week 1 - Sentiment Analysis
Implementation of sentiment classification models to analyze and predict sentiment in text data.

### Week 2 - Language Modeling
Building and training language models to predict next tokens and understand sequential patterns in text. Includes work on probabilistic language models.

### Week 3 - Machine Translation
Neural machine translation implementation with encoder-decoder architectures. Includes vocabulary files for German-English translation (`de_vocab.json`, `en_vocab.json`).

### Week 4 - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation with vector databases (Chroma) for enhanced language model responses with external knowledge retrieval.

### Week 5 - Masked Language Modeling (MLM)
Training and fine-tuning BERT-based masked language models. Includes custom tokenizers and model checkpoints for MLM tasks.

### Week 6 - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Fine-tuning models for named entity recognition tasks to identify and classify entities in text (persons, organizations, locations, etc.).

## Technologies

- PyTorch / TensorFlow for deep learning
- Hugging Face Transformers for pre-trained models
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development
- ChromaDB for vector storage and retrieval

## Setup

1. Install Python dependencies (PyTorch, Transformers, etc.)
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in each weekly folder
3. Model weights and vocabularies will be downloaded/generated during training
